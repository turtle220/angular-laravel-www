##JWT Authentication

<div class="subtitle">Get started with JWT Auth</div>

##Overview

Using Json Web Tokens for authentication will allow you to easily scale up your application, as you only need to store the tokens on the front-end.  

##Packages

We will be using [irazasyed/jwt-auth-guard](https://github.com/irazasyed/jwt-auth-guard) which is a Laravel Auth Guard on top of [tymondesigns/jwt-auth](https://github.com/)

Follow the [installation](/docs/1/jwt-auth-install/) instructions to get started with JWT Authentication.
